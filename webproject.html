                <h3>History</h3>
                <p>
Founded in 2010 by Jonathan Rodas, Artisan Saltines is dedicated to producing the highest quality saltines while remaining steadfast in our commitment to reduce hunger. The saltine cracker, a beloved snack that has been a part of countless childhoods, is at the heart of our mission. At Artisan Saltines, we aim to offer a premium selection of crackers that elevate the classic experience, satisfying the desire for a more refined snack. What began as a company offering only our signature saltines has grown into a more dynamic brand, expanding our product range to include a variety of inventive flavors, as well as our delicious Oyster Crackers. As we continue to grow, we are committed to making a positive impact on the world by donating our products to those in need and utilizing sustainable energy in the production of our iconic crackers.</p>
